# Contributing
This file contains information on how to contribute to the BenOS project. First of all, everyone is free to contribute to the system. The code is released under the MIT license.

## What means contributing?
Contributing means making changes to the project to improve it. Of course, there is a procedure to follow to keep everything in order.

## Steps
1. Fork the repository's main branch.
2. Make your own changes, test, modify whatever you like, as long as you keep the license.
3. Submit your version of the project to be merged with the main branch. You'll detail all the changes you've made in your message.

## Supplementary informations
- If your pull request is accepted and if you are on the official BenOS Discord server, you will receive the **Contributor** role.
- Please contribute to the **Indev** branch. No changes will be added to the Main branch as long as the Indev version is not finished.

Thank you in advance for your contribution!
